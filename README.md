# hacktoberfest

I'll accept nearly any pull request to DOCS.md or to create a new file in this repo. Anything but README.md is fair game. Just send me [one dollar to my paypal](https://paypal.me/syntheticgarden) per pull request. Make sure to include your github username in the comment or else I won't know who to accept the pull request from.

## Rules

Don't get me banned from GitHub.   
Don't use this to put anything shitty or bigoted on here, just change whitespace or whatever it is.    
No malware.
